# Assessing Robust Linear Regression under Covariate Contamination

This is the repository for the the final project of STAT 676 Linear Model. The simulation code are written in R and the analysis code are written in R and Python.

## Abstract
```
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of robust regression methods under covariate contamination. We focus on three primary aspects: the effectiveness of these methods against covariate contamination, the impact of correlated contamination on their performance, and their statistical power and computational efficiency. Using synthetic data, we assess the performance of M-regression, S-regression, and MM-regression compared to Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and OLS with Cook's distance diagnosis. Our findings reveal that S-regression consistently outperforms other methods in most scenarios, despite facing challenges with computational efficiency and high dimensionality, where Cook's distance diagnosis outperforms. Additionally, we apply these methods to the real-world UCI obesity dataset to validate our results, showcasing S-regression's superior performance facing inaccurate survey response.
